This directory contains the scripts to create the package lists used by the non-root installer.

SciDB-<version>.requires
- lists what libraries, executables, and scripts must already by installed on the system
  for the non-root install of SciDB to work.

SciDB-<version>.urls
- lists the packages (rpm) that the non-root installer must download, unpackage,
  and install in a local tree.

Shim-<version>.urls
- lists the shim package and supporting packages that the non-root installer
  must download, unpackage, and install in a local tree.

<version> is the version of SciDB

NOTE: non-root install is only supported for CentOS and RedHat. For RedHat we use CentOS.

The SciDB requires and urls files are produced in a chroot environment
loaded with a minimal OS.

The following are the steps to produce these files.
Note you must have sudo privilege to run these.

1. prepare_mychroot.sh <chroot_location> <OSversion>

This creates a chroot at <chroot_location> of the specified <OSversion>.
The OS is the same as the machine you are on.
The <chroot_location> must already exist.

For example on a CentOS machine:
$ prepare_mychroot.sh ~/myplace 6.3
will create a chroot at ~/myplace loaded with a minimal CentOS 6.3 operating system.

2. mychroot_run.sh -c "<commandline>" <chroot_location> [copy_in]

This will copy into <chroot_location> the files/directories specified at the end of the commandline [copy_in]
and then enter the chroot and run the <commandline>.

Continuing the example in #1 for SciDB version 14.7:
$ mychroot_run.sh -c "/repo/create_package_info.sh 14.7" ~/myplace `pwd`
will create two files in ~/myplace: scidb-14.7-all-coord.requires and scidb-14.7-all-coord.urls

Note the create_package_info.sh script takes one argument; the SciDB version.

3. cp ~/myplace/scidb-<SciDBver>-all-coord.requires ./SciDB-<SciDBver>.requires
   cp ~/myplace/scidb-<SciDBver>-all-coord.urls ./SciDB-<SciDBver>.urls
