             - if installing SciDB with P4
               <credentials> is a file with one line of the credentials (<username>:<password>) to access the P4 downloads.
  hostlist   - a file listing the hosts in the cluster
             - the first line is the coordinator

  configfile - SciDB configuration file

You must provide 2 files (3 files if you are installing P4) and a network mask.

The first option is required (-s or -p) and selects what type of installation you are doing.
    -s is a SciDB installation without P4.
    -p is a SciDB installation with P4.
    The -p must be followed with a filename that has the credentials for accessing the P4 download area.
    The credentials file has one line consisting of the <username>:<password> for accessing the P4 download area.

Hostlist is a list of the cluster hosts, one per line, with the first line designating the SciDB coordinator.

Network is the network mask of the cluster of the form W.X.Y.Z/D

Configfile is the SciDB configuration file for the cluster.
Either write your own
or use our new online tool called configurator that provides assistance selecting and building the initialization parameters file, config.ini.
