These are the known security issues that cluster_install (and indirectly qualify) creates.

* Passwordless ssh as user "root" is setup between the coordinator and all the nodes in the cluster.

* Passwordless ssh as user "scidb" is setup between the coordinator host and all the nodes in the cluster.

* ssh is run with StrictHostKeyChecking=no.

* All firewalls on all nodes are disabled permanently.

* User scidb's .bashrc file is modified.

If any of the above is unacceptable do not use cluster_install
