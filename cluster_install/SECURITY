These are the known security issues that cluster_install (and indirectly qualify) creates.

* Passwordless ssh as user "root" is setup between the installer and all the nodes in the cluster.

* Passwordless ssh as user <username> (default is "scidb") is setup between the coordinator host and all the nodes in the cluster.

* ssh is run with StrictHostKeyChecking=no.

* All firewalls on all nodes are disabled permanently.

* User <username>'s (default is "scidb") .bashrc file is modified.

If any of the above is unacceptable do not use cluster_install
