cluster_install
=======================

This shell script along with supporting scripts allows you to install and setup a SciDB cluster from the coordinator node.

This script must be run as root on the coordinator (a login shell such as "su -l root").

Before installing, this script will qualify your cluster.
This includes setting up password-less ssh keys and turning off firewalls.

./cluster_install [-s|-p <credentials>] [-u <username>] <network> <configfile>
  -s         - install SciDB
  -p <credentials>
             - install P4
               <credentials> is a file with one line of the credentials (<username>:<password>) to access the P4 downloads.
  -s -p <credentials>
             - install both SciDB and Pr
  -u <username>
             - non-root user that will run SciDB
             - defaults to user "scidb"
  network    - is the network mask the cluster is on
  	       Note: in the format of W.X.Y.Z/D
  configfile - SciDB configuration file

    The credentials file has one line consisting of the <username>:<password> for accessing the P4 download area.

[-u <username>]
This option allows you to specify the user account that will be running SciDB.
     It must not be root.
     It defaults to user "scidb".

network
    the network mask of the cluster in the form of W.X.Y.Z/D

configfile
    the SciDB configuration file for the cluster.
    Either write your own or use our new online tool called "configurator" that provides assistance
    selecting and building the initialization parameters file, config.ini.

If you have already logged in on the coordinator, you will need to source the .bashrc file to setup environment variables for this new installation.
Next time you login you will get these settings as a result of logging in.
