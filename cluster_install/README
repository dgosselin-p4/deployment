This is Paradigm4's cluster installer.

This shell script along with supporting scripts installs and sets up a SciDB cluster from the coordinator node.
It is driven from your SciDB configuration file.
There is a "configurator" in the Paradigm4 GitHub to create your own SciDB configuration file.

The cluster_install script must be run as root on the coordinator (a login shell such as "su -l root").

Before installing, this script will qualify your cluster.
This includes setting up password-less ssh keys and turning off firewalls.
See the ../qualify directory for more details.

./cluster_install [-s|-p <credentials>] [-u <username>] <network> <config_file>
  -s         - install SciDB
  -p <credentials>
             - install P4
               <credentials> is a file with one line of the credentials (<username>:<password>) to access the P4 downloads.
  -s -p <credentials>
             - install both SciDB and P4
  -u <username>
