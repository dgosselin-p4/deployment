<h3>setupPostgreSQL</h3>
<p>
setupPostgreSQL is a script, created by the non-root installer
<b>nrinstall</b>,
<br>that will initialize and run the user's own postgres.
<br>The script is installed in the user's home directory on the SciDB coordinator host.
</p>
<p>If you do not have write access to an existing PostgreSQL installation
<br>or you do not have a PostgreSQL running on the coordinator host
<br>then run the setupPostgreSQL script on the SciDB coordinator host to set one up.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is already a postgres running on the same pg-port you specified in the configuration file
<br>you will not be allowed to run your own postgres on the same port.</li>
<br>
<li>If you did not specify a pg-port in the configuration file and there is already a postgres running on the default (5432) port
<br>you will not be allowed to run your own postgres on the default port.</li>
<br>
<li>You will need to modify the SciDB configuration file (now located at $SCIDB_ROOT/opt/scidb/$SCIDB_VER/etc/config.ini)
<br>to use a different pg-port and then try setupPostgreSQL again.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The setupPostgreSQL script will ask you for the CIDR of your cluster network.
<br>This is of the form IPaddress/routing_prefix (W.X.Y.Z/N).
</p>
<p>
The setupPostgreSQL will initialize postgres and start it.
<br>If you are familiar with postgres commands then please use the ones in the install tree ($SCIDB_ROOT/...).
