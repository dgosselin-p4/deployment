This is Paradigm4's non-root installer.

It is used to install SciDB Community or Enterprise Edition when you do not have root access to the SciDB hosts.
It can provide PostgreSQL if needed and it provides the SciDB shim.

Presently the non-root installer (named nrinstall) only supports CentOS 6 and RedHat 6 and SciDB version 14.3 onwards.

The non-root installer is driven from your SciDB configuration file.
There is a "configurator" in the Paradigm4 GitHub to create your own SciDB configuration file.

The computer where you run nrinstall (called the "installer computer") does not have to be one of the hosts you will be running SciDB on.
You will run nrinstall as a regular user on the installer computer.

To get started you downloaded the deployment project from Paradigm4 on GitHub.
You change directory to "nrinstall" and run "./nrinstall" for help.

The README.nrinstall file goes into further detail about the "nrinstall" command.

==================================================
The order of events should be something like this:

    cd nrinstall
    ./nrinstall -i
    If you do not have write access to an existing PostgreSQL installation on the coordinator
        run the setupPostgreSQL script that is provided by the non-root installer nrinstall on the SciDB coordinator host.
    logout and log back into the coordinator
    scidb.py init_syscat [db] (notice scidb.py is now in your PATH)
    scidb.py initall [db]
    scidb.py startall [db]
    Do your work
    scidb.py stopall [db]
